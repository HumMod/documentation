## About Styles
We try to keep the look of the HumMod sites uniform.  As such, please do not override styles.  If you encounter a problem, [contact us](http://hummod.org/contact) and we'll see what can be done.

All pages should use the `default.html` layout.  As we finalize the styles and appropriate tags, the README will be updated.

### Tags and Usage
In progress.
