<h2 id='preface'>Preface</h2>

<p>These documents describe the rules used by HumMod, and possibly other equation solvers, to define a mathematical model.</p>

<p>Our intent was that the simulation environment would not be associated with proprietary hardware, software and formatting. Extensible Markup Language (XML) was selected as the grammar.</p>

<p>Briefly, XML uses names in angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;) to identify data. The brackets and names are called tags. Data lies between two tags. The tag – data – tag sequence is called an element and the data is called the element content.</p>

<p>There are five volumes in this document. The main task of these volumes is to describe all of the XML elements that we have defined for out modeling environment.</p>

<p><a href='1_model'>Volume 1. Model</a></p>

<p>This volume develops three topics. The first introduces XML. The second describes some additional grammatical rules to be used in model definition. The third describes the highest-level elements of the HumMod schema.</p>

<p><span>Volume 2. Structure</span></p>

<p>This volume describes the elements used in defining a model?s mathematical structure. Sections include variables, equations, functions and math.</p>

<p><span>Volume 3. Control</span></p>

<p>This volume describes control of the calculation of solutions using interactive control.</p>

<p><span>Volume 4. Display</span></p>

<p>This volume describes the elements used in creating the display of a model?s calculated solution. Tasks include selecting the variables to be displayed, selecting the display method (numerical, graph, other), and laying out the screen?s panels.</p>

<p><span>Volume 5. Misc</span></p>

<p>This volume might describe a variety of miscellaneous issues – but right now it focuses on file formats (schema) used for some of HumMod?s XML I/O.</p>
