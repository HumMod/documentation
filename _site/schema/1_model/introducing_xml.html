<p>XML is an acronym for Extensible Markup Language. This document defines the rules for using XML to document structure and details of a mathematical model in human readable and computer readable format.</p>

<p>Traditionally, a strange set of marks (like a wavy underline and a capital P facing backwards) were used by editors to communicate with typesetters, to ensure that a printed document was correctly laid out and attractive. This is called markup.</p>

<p>With the advent of the digital computer and electronic documents, a markup schema was needed that could be read by computers and transported across networks. In about 1969, Charles Goldfarb, Ed Mosher and Ray Lorie at IBM provided a solution in the form of GML – named after their last name initials (maybe). GML was intended to markup legal documents to send to the electronic typesetters that were rapidly replacing human typesetters. This scheme was renamed Generalized Markup Language (or so the story goes).</p>

<p>In the mid 1970?s, Goldfarb and others added features to GML and Generalized Markup Language became Standard Generalized Markup Language (or SGML). SGML became an ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standard in 1986 and is the current standard for document markup work. But, looking ahead, it is not a markup language. It is a specification for creating markup languages and it is very complicated.</p>

<p>In about 1990, Tim Berners-Lee and Anders Bergland at CERN in Switzerland used SGML to define Hypertext Markup Language (or HTML) and the World Wide Web was born. HTML describes how documents should look when displayed on a computer screen. HTML was not extensible, but it was corruptible. It was a weapon used in the great browser wars (and was a casualty at that).</p>

<p>There remained a need to organize data as it passed not only from database to computer screen but also from database to database. And it would be nice if the scheme was much simpler than SGML. A number of people including John Bosak, Tim Bray, James Clark and C.M. Sperberg- McQueen worked in 1996 and 1997 to define a new and better markup language using SGML as the overriding standard. Extensible Markup Language (or XML) was born. It received W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) endorsement in February 1998.</p>

<p>The extensible in XML?s name identifies one of its major strengths. XML can be customized to meet specific needs. In the case of mathematical model documentation, we?ve developed an XML schema that is used to represent the details of mathematical models, including the structure, the control of solutions and the display of results.</p>
